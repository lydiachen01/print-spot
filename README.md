# print-spot

Tufts Printing Service has a list of the locations where JumboPrint printers are located, but no other additional information.

**_Objective_**: Create an interactive map, using the OpenStreetMap API, that shows the general location of a functioning campus printer, closest to your current location. Additional features include printer type (color printer or only black/white) and a self-report option (e.g., out of paper, low on ink, and other troubleshooting issues).

**_Tech Stack_**: OpenStreetMap API, MapTiler API, Typescript, React, TailwindCSS, NodeJS, NextJS
